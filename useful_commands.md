## Programming C++ without WSL
By using visual studio build tools, you can compile and run C++ code without using WSL. This is useful for those who are not using WSL or are using Windows.
To make things work in VSCode, you open the developer terminal for visual studio and run the following command:

```bash
code
```

Now you have opened visual studio code through the developer terminal, and all of the environment variables are set up for you. 
You can now run your C++ code without any issues.
